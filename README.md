## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: Nest.js, PostgreSQL through Supabase, Next UI, TypeScript

In this project, I wanted to practice my skills with TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. I've always loved sports blogging, but when I used to sports blog, I was always intimidated that others would hate on me for my sports opinions!

BenchBanter is a safe online community for users to post sports articles, add comments, and connect with other sports writers.

## Optimizations

- Add sorting/filtering/searching on the main feed

- Add a trending section for popular articles

- Add friends section to filter your mainfeed with only posts from friends

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I was able to practice with TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL concepts, such as:

- Writing select, insert, delete, update statements with PostgreSQL through Supabase

- Passing props with TypeScript

- How TypeScript can be used to avoid errors with type checking

- How to use Next.js to easily create different routes

- How I can use Next UI to very easily create a good looking user interface

- ESLint is a great way to detect errors that could affect my app in the future

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
